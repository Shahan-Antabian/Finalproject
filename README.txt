Once in a castle, the king sent a secret message to his son, which the secret  information got leaked and failed the secret operation. Hence, they have decided to use frequencies in the messages, which not everyone would understand, as it was formed with dashes, dots and spaces. They called it the Morse code. Although they spent too much time writing long messages in Morse Code, and then it took too long to translate it into English Alphabet Letters, which would deliver the secret message.


Morse code is formed by three symbols: dash, dot and space, which in frequencies present the English Alphabet letters. It can be also recognized by unit frequencies, such as a dot has 1 unit, dash has 3 units, and space has 7 units. This secret code was used so that people who are unfamiliar with the code will not be able to easily translate the code.
Hence, the Encoder code will help the user convert the inputted text into the Morse Code, and return the form of dashes, dots and spaces.
In the Decoder code, it will take the Morse code as an Input from the user, then convert the inputted Morse Code into a group of letters and numbers, then return it to the user.


This Encoding - Decoding program will help the secret communication to be translated faster and easier, thus will be much affordable for the king and his son to communicate in such a secret way and not get the information leaked.
